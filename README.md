# GameCraft

## About

There's a ton of Minecraft clones out there - not surprising, considering that it's the best-selling videogame of all times. So what does make this one special? Well... it's not about mining. It's not even a game. _Until you make it one._

GameCraft aims to be a toolkit for prototyping, creating and running games in a voxel-based environment - with an intuitive world editor, a completely customizable block registry and scripting support to add some life to your creation!

## Project state

The current version is an early prototype and more of a development preview - it lacks many core features and optimization. But keeping projects in private repositories until they're completely done will not get me any feedback - also, that proves I didn't spend the whole quarantine slacking off and playing video games all day. Take that, Corona!

## How to run

You can either download and run the [most recent release](../../releases) or - if you want to get the latest new featues - build the project by yourself. As this project uses the [Eterra Framework](https://github.com/bauermaximilian/Eterra) and the [platform provider for windows](https://github.com/bauermaximilian/Eterra.Platforms), you'll need to clone both repositories (development branch) into the same root directory you'd clone this repository into before. See these repositories for more details.
